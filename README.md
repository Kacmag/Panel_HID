# HID_Panel_SR


The project aims to develop an interactive HID (Human Interface Device) panel connected to a computer. It will feature 4 encoders with buttons for volume control, desktop switching, and tab browsing. Hand gesture control will be supported, similar to modern cars. An OLED screen will display functions and hand gesture information. The panel will operate standalone or connected to a computer, with mode change requiring a new program upload. The enclosure will be designed in Autodesk Inventor and produced using FDM or SLA technology.
